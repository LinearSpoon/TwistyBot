# Creating a bot account
- Create a new application [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me).
- Add a name for the application. This will become the bot's initial username.
- Add a picture for the application. This will become the bot's initial avatar.
- Optionally add a description. This isn't really used for anything.
- Click "Create Application"
- Click "Create a bot user" and accept the confirmation.
- Check "Public bot" if you want people other than yourself to be able to invite the bot to their server.
- Save the token listed here. Never share your token with other people! It is your "password" that allows your code to log into the bot. If you put your code in a public repository, be careful not to commit your token. Keep your token in a separate file and add the file to your .gitignore file to ensure it isn't shared.
