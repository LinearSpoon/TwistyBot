Requires Node >= 8.2.0


The master branch of this repo contains the full customized version of TwistyBot code, which is not intended for the public to reuse. The code will not run as is, without setting up the backing database and config file with api keys and secret urls.

If you are looking to build off of TwistyBot, start with the **no_extras** branch. It is a stripped down version with some documentation and ready to use for you to build your own custom bot.
